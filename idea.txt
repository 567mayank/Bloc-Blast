How game will look -
1. When user enters the game 2 option will be provided 
2. where user can either start a new game by entering a unique gameId - which user has to remember 
3. or user can play his/her previous game by entering gameId - this gameId might serve as password 

Case 1 - where user is creating a new game 
1. we make user to enter grid size to start game 
2. and once that is done we will be save game using gameId set by the user


Case 2 - where user plays a already present game 



How Game will be saved -
1. For all games only one file will be used - as we won't have a lot of info to save [saved_data.txt]
2. Each game will separated by '#' 
3. Info saved for each game would be in this order -> 
    gameId_points_gridSize/boardState_gridSize/block1_gridSize/block2_gridSize/block3...#
4. Board or block will be saved 0 and 1 - where 0 means empty space and 1 means occupied
5. After each move is played game state would be saved 
    a. for saving we will create new file named [saved_data_new.txt]
    b. first we will copy [saved_data] file data in this new [saved_data_new.txt] file 
    c. then update the data of the specific gameId in this new file
    d. if this operation completes successfully we will rename [saved_data_new] to [saved_data]
    e. else we will repeat this process
6. In each state save process we will be updating board state, points and blocks.
7. Once the game starts [SaveGame] object will be initialzed with old data
8. Once the [saveGamesState] will be called - we will look for data for specific game id 
9. We will remove game_id data and append all that data in the end
